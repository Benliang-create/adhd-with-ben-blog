# Hey, I'm Ben 👋

I'm a guy with ADHD who got tired of productivity advice that wasn't built for brains like ours.

After years of buying planners that lasted a week, downloading apps I'd forget about, and feeling broken every time a "simple" system didn't work — I started building my own tools.

**ADHD With Ben** is where I share what actually works. No hustle culture. No "just try harder." Just practical, ADHD-friendly tools designed by someone who lives this every day.

## What I Make

I create **printable ADHD tools** — planners, habit trackers, brain dump worksheets, dopamine menus, and emotion toolkits. Everything is designed to be:

- 🧠 **ADHD-friendly** — flexible, forgiving, no streak pressure
- 🖨️ **Printable** — paper on your desk beats an app you'll forget
- ♻️ **Reusable** — print as many as you need, no guilt
- 💛 **Judgment-free** — built for imperfect consistency

*Built with 💛 and a brain that has too many tabs open.*
