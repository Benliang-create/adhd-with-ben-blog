Self-care Twitter: "Take a bubble bath! Light candles! Do yoga! Journal under the moonlight!"

ADHD self-care: "Did I eat today? Did I drink water? When did I last shower?"

Let's talk about the second kind.

## Why Basic Self-Care Is Hard With ADHD

**Interoception issues.** Many ADHD people have reduced awareness of body signals. You don't feel hungry until you're starving. You don't feel tired until you crash. You don't notice you need water until you have a headache.

**Executive function.** Self-care requires planning, initiating, and completing tasks. All things ADHD impairs.

**Boring.** Brushing teeth, showering, cooking — these are repetitive, low-stimulation tasks. ADHD brains resist boring.

**Out of sight, out of mind.** If you don't see your vitamins, you won't take them. If the water bottle isn't in front of you, you won't drink.

## The Bare Minimum Self-Care System

Forget elaborate routines. Here are the non-negotiables:

### Eat Something
Set 3 alarms: breakfast, lunch, dinner. When the alarm goes off, eat. Doesn't matter what. A granola bar counts. Getting food in your body is the goal.

### Drink Water
Keep a water bottle visible at all times. Your desk, your bedside, your bag. If it's visible, you'll drink. If it's not, you won't.

### Move
10 minutes of walking. That's it. Not a workout. A walk. Set an alarm, go outside, come back. Done.

### Sleep
Set a bedtime alarm (not just a wake-up alarm). When it goes off, start winding down. Your future self will thank you.

### Hygiene Minimum
If a full shower feels impossible, wash your face and brush your teeth. That's a win. The bar is "something," not "everything."

## The Dopamine Menu

Create a list of activities that reliably improve your mood. Not "should do" items — actual dopamine sources:

- A specific playlist
- A favorite show episode
- A walk in a specific park
- Calling a specific friend
- A specific comfort food

When you're spiraling, pull from the menu. Don't try to think of something — your brain can't problem-solve when depleted. A pre-made [dopamine menu](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-dopamine-menu) removes the decision entirely.

## Visual Cues Everywhere

Put your vitamins next to your coffee maker. Put a toothbrush by your bed (for those nights you can't make it to the bathroom). Put a water bottle on every surface. ADHD brains respond to visual cues, not internal reminders.

## Self-Care Isn't Selfish

Taking care of your basic needs isn't indulgent. It's maintenance. You can't function without fuel, water, and rest. Give yourself permission to treat survival basics as the important tasks they are.
