Week 1 of a new workout routine: I'm going to the gym every day. I bought new shoes. I have a spreadsheet. I am TRANSFORMED.

Week 3: I haven't been to the gym in 9 days and I feel guilty every time I see my gym bag.

This is the ADHD exercise cycle, and almost every person with ADHD has lived it.

## The Novelty Problem

ADHD brains run on novelty and dopamine. A new workout routine is exciting — new movements, new environment, new goals. Dopamine flows freely.

But once the novelty wears off (usually 1-3 weeks), the dopamine dries up. Without dopamine, your brain has zero motivation to continue. It's not discipline failure — it's neurochemistry.

## What Actually Works

### Never Do the Same Workout Twice
Seriously. Rotate between running, swimming, climbing, yoga, basketball, hiking, dance — whatever. The goal isn't optimization, it's consistency. Variety keeps your ADHD brain engaged.

### The 10-Minute Rule
Tell yourself you only have to exercise for 10 minutes. Put on shoes, start moving, and after 10 minutes you can stop guilt-free. Most days, you'll keep going. The hardest part is starting.

### Exercise That Doesn't Feel Like Exercise
- Walking while listening to a podcast
- Playing a sport with friends
- Dancing in your room
- Active video games (Beat Saber, Ring Fit)
- Bike riding to a destination (not just "riding for exercise")

If it feels like a chore, you won't do it. Find movement that's fun.

### Morning Exercise
Do it before your brain has time to talk you out of it. ADHD brains are better at routines that happen early, before decision fatigue sets in.

### Track It Simply
Don't track reps, sets, weights, and macros. Track one thing: did you move today? Yes or no. I use an [ADHD habit tracker](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-habit-tracker) with no streak pressure — missing a day doesn't break anything.

## Why Exercise Matters More for ADHD

Exercise increases dopamine and norepinephrine — the same neurotransmitters that ADHD medication targets. A 30-minute workout can improve ADHD symptoms for 2-4 hours.

It's basically free medication. The hard part is just doing it.

Stop chasing the perfect routine. Chase movement. Any movement. That's enough.
