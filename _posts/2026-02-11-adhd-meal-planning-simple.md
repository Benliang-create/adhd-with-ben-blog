Deciding what to eat is the worst part of having ADHD. Not the cooking — the *deciding.*

It's 6 PM. You're hungry. You open the fridge, stare at it for three minutes, close it, open the pantry, stare at that, close it, pick up your phone, and order DoorDash for the third time this week.

Sound familiar?

## Why Meal Planning Is an ADHD Nightmare

**Decision fatigue.** By evening, your ADHD brain has made thousands of micro-decisions all day. Choosing what to eat requires comparing options, planning steps, estimating time — executive functions that are already depleted.

**Working memory gaps.** You bought groceries on Monday. By Wednesday, you've forgotten what you bought. The vegetables rot. The cycle continues.

**Time blindness.** "I'll start cooking at 6" turns into "it's 8 PM and I haven't eaten."

**All-or-nothing thinking.** You see a beautiful meal prep post on Instagram, decide to do that, buy $80 of ingredients, prep for one day, and never touch it again.

## The Lazy System That Works

Forget meal prepping 15 containers on Sunday. Here's what actually works for ADHD:

### The 5-Meal Rotation
Pick 5 meals you can make without thinking. Rotate them weekly. That's it. No variety, no creativity, no decisions.

My rotation:
1. Pasta with jarred sauce
2. Rice bowl with whatever protein
3. Quesadillas
4. Stir fry (frozen vegetables + soy sauce)
5. Eggs and toast

Boring? Maybe. Sustainable? Absolutely.

### The "Always Stocked" List
Keep these items at all times: eggs, bread, pasta, rice, frozen vegetables, canned beans, cheese, and one sauce you like. With these basics, you can always make *something.*

### Batch Cook One Thing
Don't meal prep everything. Just cook a big batch of ONE thing — usually rice or protein. Having one component ready reduces the barrier to cooking the rest.

### Visual Cues
Put a sticky note on your fridge with your 5 meals. When you open the fridge and blank out, look at the note. Removes the decision entirely.

## Stop the Guilt

You don't need to be a home chef. Frozen meals are fine. Cereal for dinner is fine. Fed is the goal, not gourmet.

I plan my meals using a simple [weekly reset planner](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-weekly-reset) that has a meal section built in. Having it written down means I don't have to hold it in my (unreliable) working memory.
