What to wear. What to eat for breakfast. Which task to start with. Should I reply to this email now or later? Take the highway or side streets?

By noon, I've made hundreds of small decisions and my brain is done. Cooked. The rest of the day becomes a haze of avoidance and paralysis.

## ADHD and Decision Fatigue

Everyone experiences decision fatigue. But ADHD makes it exponentially worse because:

**Every decision costs more energy.** Neurotypical brains automate many small decisions. ADHD brains treat each one as a fresh, effortful choice.

**We can't prioritize.** All decisions feel equally important. "What to eat for lunch" carries the same mental weight as "should I take this job offer."

**Analysis paralysis.** We see too many options, consider too many variables, and freeze. The decision never gets made.

**Post-decision anxiety.** After deciding, we second-guess endlessly. "Was that the right choice? Should I change it?"

## How to Reduce Decisions

### Automate the Trivial
Wear the same style of clothes every day (Steve Jobs was onto something). Eat the same breakfast. Take the same route. Remove as many daily decisions as possible.

### Decide the Night Before
Tomorrow's outfit. Tomorrow's first task. Tomorrow's meals. Make these decisions when you have energy, not when you need them.

### The 2-Minute Decision Rule
If a decision takes less than 2 minutes to execute, just pick the first option and go. It doesn't matter if it's optimal. Done is better than perfect.

### Reduce Options
When choosing a restaurant, don't scroll through 200 options on Uber Eats. Ask a friend to give you 2 choices. Pick one. Fewer options = easier decisions.

### Use a Daily Planner
Externalize your decisions onto paper. When your day is pre-planned, you don't have to decide what to do next — you just look at the plan. My [ADHD daily planner](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-planner) has a 3-task priority system specifically designed to prevent overwhelm.

## It's Not Weakness

Struggling with decisions doesn't make you indecisive or incompetent. Your brain spends more energy on each decision than neurotypical brains do. You're doing the same work with fewer resources. That's not a character flaw — it's neurology.
