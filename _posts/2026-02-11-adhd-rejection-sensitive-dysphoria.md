Someone left me on read yesterday. Logically, I know they're probably just busy. Emotionally, I've already decided they hate me, I've replayed every interaction we've ever had looking for what I did wrong, and I'm considering never texting anyone ever again.

This is Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), and it might be the most painful part of ADHD that nobody talks about.

## What Is RSD?

RSD is an extreme emotional response to perceived rejection or criticism. The key word is "perceived" — it doesn't have to be real rejection. A slightly cold tone of voice, a friend canceling plans, constructive feedback at work — any of these can trigger a response that feels like physical pain.

And I mean that literally. Research shows that social rejection activates the same brain regions as physical pain. For ADHD brains, this pain response is amplified.

## Why ADHD Makes It Worse

ADHD brains have trouble regulating emotions. The same system that makes us impulsive and distractible also makes our emotional responses more intense and harder to control.

Add a lifetime of actual rejection — being told you're lazy, forgetful, unreliable, not living up to your potential — and you get a brain that's hypervigilant for any sign of disapproval.

It's not oversensitivity. It's a conditioned trauma response on top of neurological emotion dysregulation.

## What RSD Feels Like

- A friend doesn't reply fast enough → they secretly hate me
- Boss gives mild feedback → I'm about to be fired
- Partner sighs → they're disappointed in me as a person
- Stranger looks at me weird → something is fundamentally wrong with me
- I make a small mistake → I am a complete failure at everything

The feelings hit instantly and intensely. They can last minutes or days. And they feel absolutely real in the moment, even when you logically know they're disproportionate.

## How to Cope

**Name it.** When you feel that sudden gut-punch of rejection, say to yourself: "This is RSD." Just naming it creates a tiny bit of distance between you and the emotion.

**Wait before reacting.** RSD triggers impulsive responses — angry texts, quitting jobs, cutting people off. Give yourself a rule: no major decisions or responses for 24 hours after an RSD trigger.

**Reality check.** Ask yourself: "What's the actual evidence that this person is rejecting me?" Usually, there isn't any.

**Track your triggers.** Over time, you'll notice patterns. Certain situations, people, or times of day trigger RSD more. Awareness helps you prepare.

I use an [emotion toolkit](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-emotion-toolkit) that includes an RSD tracker and coping strategies. Having a physical worksheet to fill out during an episode helps ground me when my emotions are spiraling.

## You're Not "Too Sensitive"

If anyone has ever told you you're too sensitive, too dramatic, or overreacting — they don't understand what it's like to live with a brain that processes rejection like a physical wound.

RSD is real. It's neurological. And it's one of the most under-recognized aspects of ADHD.

You're not broken. Your brain just feels things at full volume.
