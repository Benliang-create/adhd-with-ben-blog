My brain is a browser with 47 tabs open, and journaling is the only way I've found to close some of them.

If you have ADHD, your working memory is a sieve. Thoughts come in, swirl around, crash into each other, and disappear before you can act on them. Important things get lost. Anxiety builds because you *know* you're forgetting something but can't remember what.

Writing things down is the simplest, most effective ADHD tool I've ever used.

## Why Journaling Works for ADHD

**External memory.** Your brain can't hold everything. Paper can. It's that simple.

**Reduces anxiety.** The vague dread of "I'm forgetting something" disappears when everything is written down.

**Processes emotions.** ADHD brains experience emotions intensely but process them poorly. Writing creates distance between you and your feelings, making them more manageable.

**Pattern recognition.** Over time, you start noticing patterns — what triggers bad days, what helps good days, when you're most productive. Data about yourself.

## Why Traditional Journaling Fails for ADHD

"Write a page every morning" — this will last 4 days.

ADHD journaling needs to be:
- **Fast** (under 5 minutes)
- **Structured** (not a blank page)
- **Flexible** (skip days without guilt)
- **Useful** (not just venting — actionable)

## The Brain Dump Method

This is the #1 ADHD journaling technique:

1. Set a timer for 3 minutes
2. Write down EVERYTHING in your head — tasks, worries, ideas, random thoughts
3. When the timer stops, circle the 1-3 most important items
4. Ignore the rest

That's it. You've just offloaded your mental clutter and identified your priorities. The whole thing takes 3 minutes.

I use a [brain dump worksheet](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-brain-dump) with sections for "must do," "could do," and "brain noise." Having categories makes the dump faster and more useful than a blank page.

## The One-Line Journal

If even 3 minutes feels like too much, do this: write ONE sentence about your day. That's it.

"Today was hard but I finished the report."
"Couldn't focus at all. Played video games. Not great."
"Good day. Made dinner. Went for a walk."

One sentence. Every day. You'll be shocked how valuable these become when you look back.

## Don't Buy a Fancy Journal

The graveyard of beautiful unused journals in ADHD people's homes is legendary. Use a cheap notebook, your phone's notes app, or a simple planner. The tool doesn't matter. The habit does.

## Track Your Dopamine

One unique ADHD journaling hack: track what gives you dopamine each day. Over time, you build a personal [dopamine menu](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-dopamine-menu) — a list of activities that reliably improve your mood. When you're in a slump, pull from the menu instead of doom-scrolling.

Your brain forgets what makes it happy. Write it down.
