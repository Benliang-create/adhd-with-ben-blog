For years, I was treated for anxiety alone. The medication helped a little, but something still felt off. I was still disorganized, still procrastinating, still struggling with the basics of daily life.

Then I got diagnosed with ADHD, and everything clicked.

Roughly 50% of adults with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder. These two conditions feed each other in a vicious cycle that's easy to misunderstand.

## The ADHD-Anxiety Cycle

ADHD causes disorganization, forgetfulness, and missed deadlines → These failures create real consequences → Real consequences create anxiety → Anxiety worsens ADHD symptoms (harder to focus when worried) → More failures → More anxiety.

The key question: **is the anxiety primary, or is it a response to living with unmanaged ADHD?**

For many people, treating ADHD reduces anxiety significantly — because the anxiety was caused by the chaos, not the other way around.

## How to Tell Them Apart

**ADHD anxiety looks like:**
- Worrying about forgetting something (because you forget things constantly)
- Anxiety about being late (because you're always late)
- Fear of starting tasks (because you know how hard they are for you)
- Social anxiety from years of awkward moments

**Primary anxiety looks like:**
- Worrying about things that haven't happened and probably won't
- Physical symptoms (chest tightness, nausea) without clear triggers
- Generalized dread that isn't connected to ADHD-related failures

Often, it's both. And that's okay — you can treat both simultaneously.

## Managing the Overlap

### Reduce ADHD Chaos First
Use external systems to manage tasks, time, and responsibilities. When you miss fewer deadlines, the anxiety around deadlines decreases naturally. A [daily planner](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-planner) designed for ADHD can significantly reduce the "what am I forgetting?" anxiety.

### Movement
Exercise reduces both ADHD and anxiety symptoms. Even a 15-minute walk changes your brain chemistry. This is the single most effective free intervention for both conditions.

### Limit Caffeine
This is hard for ADHD brains that rely on caffeine, but excess caffeine worsens anxiety significantly. Find your sweet spot — enough to function, not enough to spike anxiety.

### Professional Help
If you suspect you have both ADHD and anxiety, see a professional who understands both. Treatment for one without addressing the other often fails.

## You're Not "Just Anxious"

If anxiety treatment alone hasn't fully worked for you, consider whether ADHD might be part of the picture. Millions of people — especially women — are treated for anxiety for years before discovering the underlying ADHD.

Getting the full picture changes everything.
