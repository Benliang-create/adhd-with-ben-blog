I once bought a $300 keyboard because I decided at 2 AM that I was going to become a music producer. I never made a single song.

If you have ADHD, you probably have a similar story. Impulsive purchases, forgotten subscriptions, overdraft fees from bills you meant to pay but didn't, and a general sense that money just... disappears.

## Why ADHD Makes Money Hard

**Impulse control.** ADHD impairs the prefrontal cortex — the part of your brain that says "maybe don't buy that." When dopamine is low, buying something gives an instant hit.

**Time blindness.** "Future me will deal with it" is the ADHD financial motto. We genuinely struggle to connect present spending with future consequences.

**Avoidance.** Checking your bank account feels terrifying, so you don't. The less you check, the worse it gets. The worse it gets, the more you avoid it. Classic ADHD doom loop.

**Hyperfocus spending.** New hobby? Time to buy ALL the gear. NOW. Before the interest fades.

## What Actually Works

### The 24-Hour Rule
See something you want to buy? Wait 24 hours. If you still want it tomorrow, buy it. This single rule has saved me thousands. Most ADHD impulse purchases lose their appeal within hours.

### Automate Everything
Set up autopay for every bill. Set up automatic savings transfers. Remove yourself from the equation as much as possible. ADHD brains forget — automation doesn't.

### The "Fun Money" System
Instead of a strict budget (which you will abandon in 3 days), give yourself a weekly "fun money" allowance. Transfer it to a separate account or use cash. When it's gone, it's gone. No guilt for spending it, no stress about tracking categories.

### One Number to Track
Forget tracking 15 budget categories. Track ONE number: your bank balance at the end of each week. Is it going up? You're fine. Going down? Adjust. Simple enough for an ADHD brain to maintain.

### Unsubscribe From Marketing Emails
Every "SALE: 50% OFF!" email is a dopamine trap designed to trigger impulse purchases. Unsubscribe from all of them. Out of sight, out of mind — use ADHD's object permanence issues in your favor for once.

## Tools I Use

I track my spending with a simple [ADHD habit tracker](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-habit-tracker) — not a complex spreadsheet, just a daily check: did I stick to my spending plan today? Yes or no. No pressure, no streaks, no guilt.

## The Shame Spiral

The worst part of ADHD money problems isn't the money — it's the shame. "I should be able to manage this." "Other adults don't have this problem." "What's wrong with me?"

Nothing is wrong with you. Your brain's reward system and executive function work differently. Financial systems are designed for neurotypical brains. You need different systems.

Start small. Automate one bill today. That's enough.
