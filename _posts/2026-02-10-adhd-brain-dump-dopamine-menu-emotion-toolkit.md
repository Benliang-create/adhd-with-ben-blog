Some days, ADHD isn't about productivity. It's about survival.

I'm talking about the days when your brain is so loud that planning feels impossible. When you're overwhelmed but can't name a single thing that's wrong. When someone gives you slightly negative feedback and your entire world collapses for three hours.

For those days, a planner isn't enough. You need emotional and mental triage tools. And that's exactly why I built three printables that have become just as essential to my ADHD management as any daily planner.

## Tool 1: The ADHD Brain Dump Worksheet

You know that feeling when your brain is running at 1000mph and you can't grab a single thought long enough to do anything with it? That's where the brain dump comes in.

A brain dump is exactly what it sounds like: you dump everything in your head onto paper. No organizing, no prioritizing, no judgment. Just... get it out.

But a blank page can be paralyzing for ADHD brains (ironic, right?). That's why I created a structured [ADHD Brain Dump Worksheet](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-brain-dump) that guides the dump without restricting it.

### How It Works

**Section 1: The Dump Zone.** Write everything. Tasks, worries, random ideas, that thing you remembered from 2019, the song stuck in your head — all of it. Fill the space. Don't stop to think about whether it "belongs."

**Section 2: The Worry Dump.** Separate out the anxious thoughts. Things you're dreading, worst-case scenarios playing on loop, social situations you're replaying. Getting these out of the main dump helps you see that your "to-do list" is actually 30% tasks and 70% anxiety.

**Section 3: The Priority Sort.** Now that everything's on paper, circle the 3 things that actually need to happen today. Not the 15 things you feel like you "should" do. Three.

**Section 4: The Next Action.** For each of those 3 priorities, write the tiniest possible next step. Not "finish the project" — more like "open the document." ADHD brains need activation energy to be as low as possible.

### When I Use It

- Every morning before I even look at my [daily planner](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-planner)
- When I'm spiraling and can't focus
- Before bed when my brain won't shut up
- Any time I feel overwhelmed and can't name why

I print stacks of these. They're disposable by design — use it, extract your tasks, recycle the paper. No precious journal to maintain.

## Tool 2: The ADHD Dopamine Menu

Here's a question: when you're bored, understimulated, or in an ADHD slump, what do you do?

If you're like me, the answer used to be: grab my phone and scroll for two hours, then feel worse. Or eat something I didn't need. Or start an impulsive online shopping session.

The problem isn't that we seek dopamine — that's literally how our brains work. The problem is that we default to the easiest dopamine source, which is usually the least satisfying one.

Enter the [ADHD Dopamine Menu](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-dopamine-menu).

### The Concept

It's a personalized menu of feel-good activities, organized by effort level:

**🟢 Appetizers (Low effort, instant access)**
Quick hits when you need something NOW. Examples: play a favorite song, step outside for 2 minutes, stretch, text a friend, pet your dog.

**🟡 Main Courses (Medium effort, more satisfying)**
Activities that take 15-30 minutes but give a bigger dopamine payoff. Examples: go for a walk, play a musical instrument, cook something simple, do a creative project.

**🔴 Specials (Higher effort, deep satisfaction)**
The big ones that require planning but are deeply fulfilling. Examples: hike in nature, game night with friends, learning something new, a full workout.

### Why It Works for ADHD

When you're in a dopamine deficit, your executive function is at its lowest. Asking your brain to *think of something fun to do* in that state is like asking someone with a broken leg to run. The dopamine menu eliminates the thinking — you just pick from your pre-made list.

I keep mine on my fridge and on my desk. When I feel the scroll-urge, I glance at the menu instead. It doesn't work every time (I'm human), but it works way more often than willpower alone.

The printable also includes a **mood tracker** section so you can start noticing patterns — which activities actually improve your mood vs. which ones just kill time.

## Tool 3: The ADHD Emotion Toolkit (RSD Edition)

This one is personal. And it might be the most important tool I've ever made.

**RSD — Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria** — is the ADHD symptom nobody warns you about. It's not just "being sensitive." It's an intense, physical, overwhelming emotional response to perceived rejection or criticism.

Someone doesn't text back? Catastrophe. Boss gives constructive feedback? You're convinced you're getting fired. Friend makes a joke at your expense? You replay it for three days.

RSD affects an estimated 99% of adults with ADHD, but most of us have never even heard the term. We just think we're "too sensitive" or "overreacting."

The [ADHD Emotion Toolkit](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-emotion-toolkit) is a printable survival guide specifically for these emotional storms.

### What's Inside

**The RSD First Aid Protocol.** When you're in the middle of an RSD episode, you can't think clearly. This is a step-by-step guide to get through the next 30 minutes without sending that text, quitting that job, or spiraling into self-hatred.

**Emotion Identification Sheet.** ADHD often comes with alexithymia — difficulty identifying what you're feeling. This sheet helps you name the emotion, which is the first step to managing it. (There's actual neuroscience behind this: naming an emotion activates your prefrontal cortex and calms your amygdala.)

**Trigger Tracker.** Over time, you start to see patterns. Maybe Mondays are always hard. Maybe certain people consistently trigger RSD. Maybe you're more vulnerable when you haven't slept. The tracker helps you spot these patterns so you can prepare.

**Cool-Down Strategies.** Personalized coping strategies organized by situation: work criticism, social rejection, relationship conflicts, self-criticism spirals. Not generic advice — practical, ADHD-specific tools.

### Why I Made This

Because I spent years thinking my emotional intensity was a character flaw. Learning about RSD was like getting glasses for the first time — suddenly everything made sense. And I wanted to give other people that clarity, plus actual tools to handle it.

## Using All Three Together

Here's my ADHD bad day protocol:

1. **Brain Dump** first — empty the chaos onto paper
2. **Emotion Toolkit** if I'm in an emotional spiral — stabilize before trying to be productive
3. **Dopamine Menu** to gently re-engage — pick one appetizer, then maybe a main course
4. **Daily Planner** only after the above — now I'm ready to pick my top 3 tasks

Not every day needs all four steps. But having them ready means I'm never stuck with zero tools and a brain that's on fire.

## The Full System

All three of these tools are available individually, or as part of the [ADHD Complete Toolkit](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-complete-toolkit) — a 54-page printable PDF that includes all 7 of my ADHD tools. If you want everything organized and ready to go, the [Complete Bundle](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-toolkit-bundle) gives you each kit as a separate printable file.

These aren't clinical tools or therapy replacements. They're practical, printable worksheets designed by someone who lives with ADHD every day and got tired of systems that weren't built for brains like ours.
