I once sat down to "quickly check email" and looked up to find that three hours had passed. Not exaggerating. Three hours.

This is time blindness, and it's one of ADHD's cruelest symptoms. Time doesn't flow normally for us — it either crawls or vanishes. There's no in-between.

## What Is Time Blindness?

Neurotypical brains have an internal clock that roughly tracks time passing. ADHD brains don't. We genuinely cannot feel time moving. Five minutes and two hours feel identical.

This isn't carelessness. Brain imaging shows that ADHD affects the same regions responsible for time perception. It's neurological.

## Strategies That Help

### Make Time Visible
Since you can't feel time, you need to SEE it. Use analog clocks (watching hands move is more intuitive than digital numbers). Use visual timers like Time Timer that show time as a shrinking colored disk.

### The "How Long Does This Actually Take?" Log
ADHD brains are terrible at estimating how long tasks take. Start logging actual times. "Getting ready" isn't 15 minutes — it's 45. "Quick grocery run" isn't 20 minutes — it's an hour. Once you know real times, you can plan realistically.

### Time Blocking With Buffers
Block your day into chunks, but add 15-30 minute buffers between tasks. ADHD transitions are slow. Without buffers, one late task cascades into a ruined day.

I use an [ADHD time blocking template](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-time-blocking) that has built-in buffer zones and matches tasks to energy levels.

### Set Alarms for Everything
Not just wake-up alarms. Set alarms for: leaving the house, starting tasks, stopping tasks, meals, bedtime prep. Your phone is your external prefrontal cortex. Use it.

### The "What Time Will It Be?" Game
Before starting any task, ask: "If this takes 30 minutes, what time will it be when I finish?" Then set an alarm for that time. This forces your brain to connect the present moment with a future time.

### Avoid Time Traps
Know your danger zones — activities where time vanishes. For me: social media, video games, and "quick" research. Set hard timers before entering these zones.

## Embrace "ADHD Time"
Tell people you'll be there at 2:00, but internally plan for 1:30. Give yourself the buffer your brain needs. It's not lying — it's accommodation.

Your relationship with time will never be "normal." But it can be managed.
