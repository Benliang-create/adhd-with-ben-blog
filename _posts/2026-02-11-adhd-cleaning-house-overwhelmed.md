Let me describe a scene you probably know well: you look around your apartment and see dishes in the sink, laundry on the floor, mail piled on the counter, and random objects everywhere. You know you need to clean. But instead of starting, you feel completely paralyzed.

Welcome to ADHD cleaning paralysis.

## Why Cleaning Is So Hard With ADHD

It's not laziness. It's a perfect storm of ADHD symptoms:

**Task initiation failure.** Starting a task requires executive function. ADHD impairs executive function. So even though you *want* to clean, your brain can't fire the "start" signal.

**Overwhelm from complexity.** "Clean the house" isn't one task — it's 50 tasks. An ADHD brain sees all 50 simultaneously and short-circuits.

**No dopamine reward.** Cleaning is low-stimulation, repetitive work. ADHD brains are chronically under-stimulated. Your brain literally doesn't want to do boring things — not because you're lazy, but because your reward system is wired differently.

**Object permanence issues.** Out of sight, out of mind. That pile of stuff? Your brain stopped registering it days ago.

## The 5-Minute Rule

This is the single best cleaning hack for ADHD: **set a timer for 5 minutes and clean until it goes off.**

That's it. You have full permission to stop after 5 minutes. But here's the secret — once you start, momentum often carries you past the timer. The hardest part is always starting.

## The "One Room, One Task" Method

Don't "clean the house." Instead:
- Pick ONE room
- Pick ONE type of task (only trash, only dishes, only laundry)
- Do only that

Tomorrow, pick a different room or task. Over a week, the house gets clean without any single overwhelming session.

## Body Doubling Works

Clean with someone else present — a friend, a roommate, or even someone on a video call. There are even "body doubling" apps and Discord servers for this. Having another person nearby activates ADHD brains in a way that solo tasks don't.

## Music Is Your Weapon

Put on music with a strong beat. Create a cleaning playlist. The rhythm provides external stimulation that your brain craves, making the boring task more bearable.

## Use a Brain Dump First

Before cleaning, spend 2 minutes writing down everything that needs to be done. Get it out of your head and onto paper. This reduces the overwhelm because now it's a list, not a swirling chaos.

I use a [brain dump worksheet](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-brain-dump) designed for ADHD — it has sections for "must do," "could do," and "want to do" so you can prioritize without overthinking.

## Lower Your Standards

Your home doesn't need to look like Instagram. "Good enough" is the goal. A slightly messy but functional home is infinitely better than a home you're too paralyzed to touch.

You're not a failure for having a messy house. You have a brain that makes cleaning harder than it is for most people. Work with it, not against it.
