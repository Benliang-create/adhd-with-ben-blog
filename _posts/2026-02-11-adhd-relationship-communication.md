My partner says something important. I'm looking right at them, nodding, making eye contact. Inside my head, I'm thinking about whether we need milk, replaying a conversation from work, and wondering if I left the stove on.

Five minutes later: "What did I just say?" "Um..."

ADHD doesn't just affect you. It affects everyone close to you. And relationships take the biggest hit.

## How ADHD Damages Relationships

**Forgetting things your partner told you.** Not because you don't care — because working memory is impaired.

**Zoning out during conversations.** Your partner feels unheard. You feel guilty.

**Emotional reactivity.** ADHD emotions are intense and fast. Small disagreements escalate because you react before thinking.

**Unfinished chores and broken promises.** "I'll do the dishes" → you genuinely forgot → your partner thinks you don't care.

**Hyperfocus on new relationships, neglect in established ones.** The dopamine rush of a new relationship fades. Without novelty, ADHD brains struggle to maintain the same attention.

**RSD.** Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria means a mildly critical comment from your partner feels like a devastating attack.

## What Helps

### Educate Your Partner
Your partner needs to understand that ADHD is neurological, not behavioral. When you forget something, it's not because you don't care. Shared understanding reduces resentment on both sides.

### External Memory Systems
Don't rely on remembering what your partner tells you. Write it down immediately. Shared calendars, reminder apps, notes on the fridge — make it impossible to forget.

### Scheduled Check-Ins
Set a weekly time to talk about how things are going. This prevents issues from building up until they explode. Structure helps ADHD brains engage in difficult conversations.

### Pause Before Reacting
When you feel an emotional reaction building, say: "I need a minute before I respond." Walk away, breathe, then come back. This prevents RSD-fueled reactions from damaging the conversation.

### Divide Tasks by Strength
Maybe you're terrible at remembering to pay bills but great at cooking. Play to your strengths instead of forcing yourself to do things that ADHD makes nearly impossible.

### Use an [emotion toolkit](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-emotion-toolkit) together. Tracking emotional triggers helps both you and your partner understand patterns and avoid recurring conflicts.

## It Takes Two

ADHD relationship problems aren't just the ADHD partner's responsibility. Both people need to adapt. The ADHD partner works on management strategies. The non-ADHD partner works on patience and understanding.

Neither of you is the villain. You're two people navigating a neurological condition together.
