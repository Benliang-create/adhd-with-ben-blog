It's midnight. You have to wake up at 7. You've been in bed for an hour. Your brain is running a highlight reel of every embarrassing thing you've done since 2009, simultaneously planning tomorrow's tasks, composing an imaginary argument, and playing a song on repeat.

ADHD and sleep problems go together like coffee and... well, ADHD and coffee (that's another article).

## Why ADHD Brains Won't Sleep

**Delayed circadian rhythm.** Research shows most ADHD adults have a delayed sleep phase — our brains naturally want to sleep 1-2 hours later than neurotypical brains. It's biological, not behavioral.

**Racing thoughts.** During the day, external stimulation occupies your brain. At night, with no input, your brain generates its own stimulation. Hence the 2 AM existential crisis.

**Revenge bedtime procrastination.** You finally have unstructured free time. No one needs anything from you. Your brain wants to ENJOY this, even at the cost of tomorrow's misery.

**Stimulant medication.** If you take ADHD meds, they may be affecting your sleep even hours after the last dose.

## What Actually Helps

### The Wind-Down Routine
ADHD brains need transition time. You can't go from scrolling TikTok to sleeping in 5 minutes. Start winding down 30-60 minutes before bed:

- Dim the lights
- Put your phone in another room (this is non-negotiable)
- Do something low-stimulation: read, stretch, listen to calm music

### Bore Your Brain to Sleep
Your brain is too active? Give it something boring to process:

- Listen to a monotone podcast or audiobook
- Count backwards from 300 by 3s
- Mentally walk through a familiar building room by room

The goal is to give your brain just enough stimulation to stop generating its own, but not enough to keep you awake.

### Body Temperature Hack
Take a warm shower 1-2 hours before bed. The subsequent drop in body temperature signals your brain that it's sleep time. This is especially effective for ADHD brains with disrupted temperature regulation.

### Consistent Wake Time > Consistent Bedtime
You can't force yourself to fall asleep, but you can force yourself to wake up. Set the same alarm every day (yes, weekends too). Your sleep schedule will eventually adjust.

### White Noise
ADHD brains are hyper-responsive to sounds. A white noise machine blocks random noises that would otherwise pull you out of light sleep.

## Stop Fighting Your Chronotype

If your natural sleep time is 1 AM - 9 AM, and your life allows it, just do that. Fighting your biology every night is exhausting and pointless.

Not everyone is meant to be a morning person. ADHD brains especially tend to be night owls. That's not a flaw — it's neurology.
