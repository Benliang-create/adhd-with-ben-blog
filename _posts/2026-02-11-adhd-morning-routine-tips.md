If you have ADHD, mornings probably feel like a battle. The alarm goes off, and your brain immediately starts negotiating: five more minutes, ten more minutes, okay maybe just skip the whole morning.

I've been there. For years, I tried to follow those picture-perfect morning routines — wake up at 5 AM, meditate, journal, exercise, eat a balanced breakfast. By day three, I was back to scrolling my phone in bed for 45 minutes.

Here's what I've learned: **the best ADHD morning routine is the one you actually do.**

## Why Traditional Morning Routines Fail for ADHD Brains

Our brains have lower baseline dopamine. In the morning, dopamine is at its lowest point. Asking an ADHD brain to execute a complex routine when dopamine is bottomed out is like asking a car to race with an empty tank.

Traditional advice says "just be disciplined." But discipline requires executive function, which is exactly what ADHD impairs. It's not a willpower problem — it's a neurochemistry problem.

## The 3-Task Morning

Instead of a 10-step routine, I use a 3-task system:

1. **One body task** — shower, brush teeth, or get dressed (pick ONE)
2. **One fuel task** — coffee, water, or a simple breakfast
3. **One win task** — the smallest possible work task to build momentum

That's it. If I do all three, it's a good morning. If I do two, it's still fine. The bar is low on purpose.

## Tricks That Actually Help

**Put your phone in another room.** The #1 morning killer for ADHD is the phone scroll spiral. I charge mine in the kitchen now.

**Prep the night before.** Decision fatigue is real. Lay out clothes, set up the coffee maker, put your keys by the door. Morning-you will thank night-you.

**Use body doubling.** Put on a podcast or YouTube video while getting ready. Having another "presence" helps ADHD brains stay on task.

**Don't sit down.** Seriously. Once an ADHD person sits on the couch in the morning, it's over. Stay vertical until you've done your 3 tasks.

## Tools That Help

I use a simple daily planner designed specifically for ADHD brains — it has space for just 3 priority tasks, energy tracking, and dopamine-friendly check boxes. You can [grab it here](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-planner) if you want to try it.

The key insight: **reduce decisions, reduce steps, reduce friction.** Your ADHD brain will thank you.

## The Real Secret

Stop comparing your mornings to neurotypical people's mornings. If you got out of bed, got dressed, and started your day — that's a win. Full stop.

Progress isn't about perfect mornings. It's about slightly less chaotic ones, consistently.
