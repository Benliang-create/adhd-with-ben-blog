There's a specific kind of exhaustion that ADHD people experience. It's not normal tiredness. It's a deep, bone-level depletion where your brain simply refuses to function anymore.

Everything feels impossible. Getting out of bed. Responding to messages. Making food. Basic tasks that you could normally power through with caffeine and panic now feel like climbing Everest.

This is ADHD burnout, and it's different from regular burnout.

## What Makes ADHD Burnout Different

**Regular burnout** comes from overwork. Rest fixes it.

**ADHD burnout** comes from the constant effort of functioning in a world not designed for your brain. Rest helps, but it doesn't address the root cause — you've been spending 3x the energy as neurotypical people just to appear "normal."

Causes include:
- **Years of masking** — pretending you don't have ADHD, building elaborate systems to compensate, never letting the struggle show
- **Hyperfocus crashes** — pouring all your energy into one thing until there's nothing left
- **Decision fatigue accumulation** — thousands of extra-effortful decisions, day after day
- **Emotional exhaustion** — from intense emotions with no recovery time
- **The shame tax** — the extra mental energy spent on self-criticism and guilt

## Signs You're Burning Out

- Tasks that were manageable are now impossible
- Your coping systems have collapsed (stopped using your planner, stopped meal prepping)
- You're sleeping more but feeling worse
- Irritability over tiny things
- Complete loss of motivation — not just for boring tasks, but for things you normally enjoy
- Feeling like you're "broken" beyond repair

## How to Recover

### Step 1: Stop Adding
Stop taking on new commitments. Say no to everything non-essential. Your plate is full — actually, it fell off the table.

### Step 2: Drop the Mask
If you've been pretending to be fine, stop. Tell someone you trust that you're struggling. The energy spent maintaining appearances is massive.

### Step 3: Return to Basics
Forget your elaborate productivity system. Reduce to survival mode:
- Did I eat today?
- Did I drink water?
- Did I sleep?

That's the bar. Everything else is bonus.

### Step 4: Move Your Body
Not a workout. Not a gym session. Just walk outside for 10 minutes. Sunlight + movement is the most basic brain reset.

### Step 5: Reduce Sensory Input
ADHD burnout often includes sensory sensitivity. Quiet rooms, dim lights, comfortable clothes. Give your overstimulated nervous system a break.

### Step 6: Rebuild Slowly
When you start feeling better, don't immediately rebuild all your systems at once. Add one thing at a time. One routine. One habit. One tool.

A [weekly reset planner](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-weekly-reset) can help you rebuild gently — it focuses on just 3 priorities per week, not an overwhelming daily to-do list.

## Prevention

ADHD burnout is cyclical. You'll recover, rebuild, and eventually burn out again unless you make structural changes:

- Build rest INTO your schedule, not after collapse
- Set boundaries on how much you compensate for your ADHD
- Ask for accommodations at work
- Stop measuring yourself against neurotypical standards

You're not failing. You're exhausted from succeeding on hard mode for too long.
