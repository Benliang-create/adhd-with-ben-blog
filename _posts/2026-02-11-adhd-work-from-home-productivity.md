Working from home with ADHD is like being locked in a room with every possible distraction and being told to focus. The fridge is right there. Your bed is right there. Netflix is one click away. And nobody is watching.

I've worked from home for years with ADHD. Here's what actually helps.

## The Core Problem

Office environments, despite their annoyances, provide something ADHD brains desperately need: **external structure.** Other people are working around you. There's a schedule. There are social consequences for scrolling Reddit for two hours.

At home, all that external structure disappears. And ADHD brains are terrible at creating internal structure. That's literally what the disorder impairs.

## Create Fake Structure

Since you can't generate internal structure, manufacture external structure:

**Designated workspace.** Not your couch. Not your bed. A specific spot that your brain associates with "work." Even if it's just a corner of your kitchen table — consistency matters.

**Wear real clothes.** Sounds dumb, but changing out of pajamas signals to your brain that it's work time. It's a physical transition that creates a mental one.

**Set artificial deadlines.** ADHD brains work best under time pressure. Use the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) or set fake deadlines earlier than real ones.

## The Hardest Part: Starting

Every day, the hardest moment is opening your laptop and beginning. Here's my trick: **start with the smallest possible task.** Reply to one email. Write one sentence. Open one document. Momentum builds from micro-actions.

## Dopamine Management

Your brain will seek stimulation whether you plan for it or not. So plan for it:

- **Scheduled breaks** — every 45-60 minutes, do something stimulating (walk, snack, music)
- **Background stimulation** — lo-fi music, ambient noise apps, or even having a TV show on mute
- **Reward stacking** — pair boring tasks with small rewards (finish this report → get coffee)

## Time Blocking for ADHD

Traditional time blocking doesn't work for ADHD because it assumes you can predict your energy levels. Instead, try **energy-based time blocking:**

- **High energy?** → Do the hardest task
- **Medium energy?** → Do admin/emails
- **Low energy?** → Do mindless tasks or take a break

I use an [ADHD time blocking template](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-time-blocking) that matches tasks to energy levels instead of clock times.

## Kill the Guilt

You will have unproductive days. That's not an ADHD thing — that's a human thing. But ADHD adds a layer of shame that makes it worse.

One bad day doesn't erase a good week. Give yourself the same grace you'd give a friend.

## The Nuclear Option

If nothing works and you absolutely cannot focus at home, go somewhere else. A coffee shop, a library, a co-working space. Sometimes the best work-from-home strategy is to not work from home.

Your ADHD brain needs novelty. Give it some.
