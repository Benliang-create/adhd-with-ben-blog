College with ADHD is a special kind of challenge. For the first time, there's no parent structuring your day, no teacher checking your homework, and no one stopping you from playing video games until 4 AM on a Tuesday.

I barely survived college with undiagnosed ADHD. Here's what I wish I'd known.

## Why College Is ADHD on Hard Mode

**No external structure.** High school had bells, schedules, and teachers watching. College has "figure it out yourself."

**Long-term deadlines.** "Paper due in 3 weeks" is meaningless to an ADHD brain until it's "paper due in 3 hours."

**Reading-heavy workload.** ADHD brains struggle with sustained reading. College is 90% reading.

**Freedom + impulsivity.** Unlimited freedom + impaired impulse control = skipped classes, missed deadlines, and regret.

## Study Strategies That Work

### Study in Short Bursts
Forget 3-hour study sessions. Do 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off (Pomodoro). Or even 15/5. Your brain can sprint but not marathon.

### Change Locations
Study in a different spot each session. Library, coffee shop, empty classroom, park bench. Novelty keeps ADHD brains engaged.

### Teach It to Someone
The best way to learn with ADHD is to explain it out loud. Study with a friend and take turns teaching each other. This activates different brain pathways than passive reading.

### Use Active Recall, Not Re-Reading
Re-reading notes feels productive but doesn't work for ADHD brains (or any brains, actually). Instead: close your notes, write down everything you remember, then check what you missed. This is harder and more effective.

### Record Lectures
You will zone out during lectures. It's inevitable. Recording them means you can replay the parts you missed. Many universities allow this with professor permission.

### Body Doubling in Libraries
Study near other people who are studying. Not with friends (too distracting) — near strangers who are quietly working. Their focused energy is contagious.

### Use a Planner Religiously
Write every deadline, every assignment, every exam in one place. Check it daily. An [ADHD daily planner](https://adhdwithben.gumroad.com/l/adhd-planner) with a 3-task priority system prevents the "I have 15 things due and I'm doing none of them" spiral.

## Get Accommodations

Most colleges have disability services. ADHD qualifies. Common accommodations include:
- Extended time on exams
- Note-taking services
- Priority registration
- Reduced course load

Using accommodations isn't cheating. It's leveling the playing field.

## Talk to Your Professors

Most professors are understanding if you're upfront about ADHD (you don't have to disclose details). Saying "I have ADHD and I'm working on managing it, I might need some flexibility" goes a long way.

## You Belong Here

Having ADHD in college doesn't mean you're not smart enough. It means your brain needs different strategies. Find them, use them, and ask for help when you need it.
